\section{Expected Contributions}\label{sec:expected-results}

The expected contributions to the scientific discourse have already been elaborated in detail in previous sections, so I will only give a condensed account here.

\begin{itemize}
  \item An up\-/to\-/date definition of the schema management problem domain which can serve as a basis for further work.
  \item A set of characteristics of schema management solutions to serve as a basis for the evaluation of such.
  \item An overview of available schema management solutions together with a comparison based on the characteristics.
\end{itemize}
