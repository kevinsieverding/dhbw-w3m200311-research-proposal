% Context

The trend away from licensed, on\-/premise enterprise software towards so called \gls{saas} has been going strong for the past decade and shows no sign of stopping.
This new paradigm---characterized by pay\-/per\-/use business models and provisioning on the provider's rather than the customer's infrastructure---also has a profound impact on the design of modern enterprise software.

Modern applications are now commonly composited of multiple, integrated micro\-/services developed by mostly autonomous and independent teams.
Additionally, while the synchronous, HTTP\-/based mode of communication still dominates the user\-/system communication, asynchronous, message-based approaches have become popular for intra-application communication.

In systems that employ both of these patterns---micro\-/services and message\-/based communication---messages quickly exceed synchronous HTTP\-/calls in volume.
As a result, the correct use of messages by the system's individual components becomes paramount to the overall system's availability.
Schema technologies like Apache Avro\footnote{\url{https://avro.apache.org/}}, JSON Schema\footnote{\url{https://json-schema.org/}}, Apache Thrift\footnote{\url{https://thrift.apache.org/}} or Google's Protocol Buffers\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/}} can be used to establish a shared understanding about a message's payload between publishers and consumers.
But, how are schemas going to be distributed to message consumers?
And how can the communication contract represented by schemas be enforced to ensure that publishers will not break it?
Also, as with any \gls{api}, schemas have to evolve to match changes in the system.
How can such changes be facilitated while still enforcing the communication contract?

All of these questions belong to the domain of schema management and many projects rely on a dedicated software component to implement the requirements of schema management---a so\-/called schema registry.
The work that is reviewed in section \ref{sec:related-work} reveals gaps in the contemporary literature.
Namely, (a) that the current use of schema management in research is confined to a relatively small scope (b) that no direct examination of the contemporary problem domain of schema management exists and (c) that all works which include schema management as part of their system design use the Confluent Schema Registry.

This work aims to shine a light into the little examined domain of schema management to serve as a basis for further study and as a reference for both academic and commercial projects that consider implementing schema management.
To this end, I plan to address the concerns (b) and (c) by creating a concise definition of schema management, as well as a set of characteristics of schema management solutions which I then use to compare the schema management solutions currently available.
